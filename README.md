# 🛡️ Security Hackathon AI Suite — Terricon Valley

> **🏅 3rd Place Winner, Terricon Valley Security Hackathon**

Welcome! This repository contains our team’s comprehensive and modular codebase from the Security Hackathon hosted by Terricon Valley. The system is built around futuristic, AI-driven security agents and a suite of tools to empower vulnerability discovery and technological reconnaissance—both locally and remotely. Everything is tied together through a robust orchestrator backend and a sleek web frontend.

## 🔍 Project Structure

- **agent**  
  _An agent of the future_ — an AI-powered script that can autonomously execute step-by-step vulnerability tests against services. It simulates how an intelligent adversary might probe target systems, helping you proactively measure and harden your defenses.

- **local**  
  Script for local technology reporting. It runs on a server and pushes data on detected software and frameworks to your main backend for inventorying and further analysis.

- **botscannertg**  
  A remote scanner that detects technologies in use on your servers over the network. Ideal for asset discovery and external audits.

- **front**  
  The project’s modern frontend. Provides a UI for managing scans, visualizing results, and interacting with the suite’s capabilities.

- **orchestrator**  
  The main backend service. Coordinates all modules, handles communication, aggregates results, and exposes APIs for automation and user interaction.
